rpgnode

This was a barely developed skeleton from an attempt to implement a multiplayer
RPG using socket.io. I never got very far on it before abandoning it.

I'm adding it to Github just to have it somewhere.

Like nodemoo, it's abandoned at this point.

This code is from 2011, so no idea if it will still run in a modern node.js.

Given how unfinished this is, I'm not even going to bother adding a license
to it. It's public domain, and not much better than the hello world app from
socket.io.

Cheers.
